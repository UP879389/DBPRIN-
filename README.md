Crazy Cat Pubs
Crazy Cat Public Houses are venues that provide beverages and food in many high street
locations throughout the UK. They own approximately 60 buildings in the most popular
areas of large cities in the UK. Each venue sells both drinks (alcoholic and non- alcoholic) as
well as having a reasonably broad food menu. They provide breakfasts, lunches and dinners.
They are exceedingly busy due to their competitive pricing.
They require a new database management system to replace the original system they had in
place as this is no longer viable for the amount of data they are storing. They would like a
design for a centralised database that allows web interface access for the employees.
The database keeps records of all the sales of food and drink, stock control for food and
drink and employee shifts to show who is on duty at what time.
Their menus are a Breakfast menu, a Lunch menu and a Dinner menu all with several
options on each. These vary in price, so there is a small breakfast for £3.10 and a Large
Breakfast for £5.00 or Toast with Tea or Coffee for £2.50.
Lunches are dishes such as Lasagne £5.50, Fish and Chips £6.00 etc. and the dinner menu
prices are slightly higher with, for example Burger and a Pint for £7.50 or a Steak at £10.
This is just an example of what are on the menus. The menus may change over time but
they are not expecting them to change every week. The menu and prices are the same in
every location.
The drinks are the usual range of alcoholic drinks such as beer, lager and spirits. Nonalcoholic such as orange juice and hot drinks such as tea and coffee.
Crazy Cat need to capture the sale of all of these items. They use this data for stock control
and to place large bulk orders for food and drink. Additionally they use it for Business
Intelligence showing them when their busy times are, how many repeat customers they get,
comparison of sales across venues and to plan for staffing.
In every location there are Venue Managers, Bar Managers, Bar Staff, Waiters, Kitchen
Porters, Chefs and Cleaners employed. The size of the venue will determine the number of
staff employed in the venue. The three main staff are the venue manager, the bar manager
and the chef. These are the only staff on a full time, permanent contract. All other staff are
part time and have casual contracts. Even though they are a big chain and looking for
efficiencies they do not believe in zero hour contracts so all staff are paid for a minimum of
10 hours per week.
The sales are captured through electronic tills and customers can pay by cash or card.
